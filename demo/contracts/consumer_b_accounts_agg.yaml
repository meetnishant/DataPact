# ============================================================================
# CONSUMER B CONTRACT: Deposit Accounts - Aggregate Analytics (Finance Analytics Team)
# ============================================================================
# Scenario: Scenario 1 - Baseline Validation (PASS)
# Consumer: Finance Analytics Team (Consumer B)
# Strictness: RELAXED / AGGREGATE-TOLERANT - Allows some nulls for analytics use case
#
# Business Purpose:
#   - Finance Analytics team uses this data for aggregated reporting and dashboards
#   - Can tolerate some missing data (nulls) because they aggregate large datasets
#   - Uses max_null_ratio rules instead of strict not_null requirements
#   - Focuses on trends and patterns rather than operational precision
#
# Demo Flow:
#   - Scenario 1: Validates successfully against baseline producer data (PASS)
#   - Not affected by 'suspended' status breaking change because status is optional
#
# Key Differences from Producer/Consumer A:
#   - customer_id: required=false, max_null_ratio=0.02 (allows 2% nulls for orphaned records)
#   - status: required=false, max_null_ratio=0.05 (allows 5% nulls for data quality issues)
#   - account_id: Still required for join keys, but NOT unique (aggregate tolerance)
#   - balance: Still strict (not_null, 0-20M range) for financial accuracy
#
# This demonstrates how different consumers can have different tolerance levels for the same dataset.
