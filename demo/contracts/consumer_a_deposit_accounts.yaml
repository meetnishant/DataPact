# ============================================================================
# CONSUMER A CONTRACT: Deposit Accounts (Deposits Operations Team)
# ============================================================================
# Scenario: Scenario 1 - Baseline Validation (PASS) / Scenario 2 - Breaking Change (FAIL)
# Consumer: Deposits Operations Team (Consumer A)
# Strictness: STRICT - Exact match with producer contract for operational integrity
#
# Business Purpose:
#   - Deposits Operations team relies on this data for daily account management
#   - Requires strict validation because this feeds into regulatory reporting systems
#   - All fields must be present with no nulls (operational requirement)
#   - Status enum is critical: only 'active', 'dormant', 'closed' allowed initially
#
# Demo Flow:
#   - Scenario 1: Validates successfully against baseline producer data (PASS)
#   - Scenario 2: Producer adds 'suspended' status → this contract FAILS (breaking change)
#   - Scenario 3: Updated contract (consumer_a_deposit_accounts_updated.yaml) accepts 'suspended'
#
# Key Rules:
#   - Identical to producer contract initially (strict consumer)
#   - Status enum does NOT include 'suspended' (causes Scenario 2 failure)
#   - All fields required: not_null=true, unique where applicable
